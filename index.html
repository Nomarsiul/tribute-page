        <p id="tribute-info"><em><strong>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</strong></em> (1892–1973) was a major scholar of the
            English language, specialising in Old and Middle English. Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at
            the University of Oxford, he also wrote a number of stories, including most famously <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit"><strong>The Hobbit (1937)</strong></a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings"><strong>The Lord of the Rings
                    (1954–1955)</strong></a>, which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version of our world
            which he called by the Middle English name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth"
                target="_blank">Middle-earth</a>. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves,
            Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the English
            Literature establishment, with honourable exceptions, but loved by literally millions of readers worldwide.

        <p>In the 1960s he was taken up by many members of the nascent <em>“counter-culture”</em> largely because of his
            concern with environmental issues. In 1997 he came top of three British polls, organised respectively by
            Channel
            4 / Waterstone’s, the Folio Society, and SFX, the UK’s leading science fiction media magazine, amongst
            discerning readers asked to vote for the greatest book of the 20th century. Please note also that his name
            is
            spelt Tolkien (there is no “Tolkein”). </p><br> <br>
